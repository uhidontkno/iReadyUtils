# iReady Free Rewards
* What does this do?
  When you go to the Rewards page and run the script, all of the rewards will become free and clicking on any of them will open a new tab with the game
* What EXACTLY does this do?
  1. Mimicks the rewards grid by creating a similar grid ontop of it.
  2. Adds blank items that are exactly the same size as all of the cards to make it impossible to click the real cards under them.
  3. When one of the overlay cards is clicked, it opens a new tab with the direct URL to the game instead essentially making the game free.
