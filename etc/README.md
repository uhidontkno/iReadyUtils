# hi there!
`hosts` is a file that blocks iready urls <br>
`adminMode` enables Dashboard Admin <br>
`iModal` is what i-Ready uses to show things, like Security Violations, ready to continue, so you could make funnies with it after importing iModal.
```js
iModal.showModal({
  "useInnerHTML": true,
  "title" : "say gex",
  "description" : "gay sex!!!1!11!",
  "width" : "610px",
  "callback" : iModal.closeModal,
});
```
<br>
`610px` is approx. the default size for modals.
